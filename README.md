# bubble_segmentation_Mask_RCNN

This framework allow you to segment bubbles on images. If you want to segment foam images from your device, run the notbook 'Mask_RCNN_automatic_segementation.ipynb' on colab, a window will open to select the images from your devise. To use google colab, I recommend you to use google chrome.

If you want to see how was done the training prosess, open the notbook 'train_Mask_RCNN.ipynb', the code is adapted for colab.

The notbook 'Comparative_evaluation.ipynb' compare the performances of Mask_RCNN with Unet.

All the segmentation process is based on the framework 'Mask_RCNN' available here:
